  ->Animating Views

  translationX and translationY: These properties control where the View is located as a delta from its left and top coordinates which are set by its layout container.
  rotation, rotationX, and rotationY: These properties control the rotation in 2D (rotation property) and 3D around the pivot point.
  scaleX and scaleY: These properties control the 2D scaling of a View around its pivot point.
  pivotX and pivotY: These properties control the location of the pivot point, around which the rotation and scaling transforms occur. By default, the pivot point is located at the center of the object.
  x and y: These are simple utility properties to describe the final location of the View in its container, as a sum of the left and top values and translationX and translationY values.
  alpha: Represents the alpha transparency on the View. This value is 1 (opaque) by default, with a value of 0 representing full transparency (not visible).

  x和y指的是view最终要抵达的坐标。

② property animation 没有相对之说
 需要指定绝对的数值：
 ObjectAnimator translationX = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(view, "translationX", getResources().getDisplayMetrics().widthPixels);

③ Animating with ViewPropertyAnimator
myView.animate().x(50f).y(100f);
